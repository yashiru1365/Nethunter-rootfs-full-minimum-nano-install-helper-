# Nethunter-rootfs-full-minimum-nano-install-helper-
I tried to solve some of the problems that occur during the installation of NetHunter.
Kali Net Hunter is the official app, and all I did was fix some of the issues I encountered during installation. 

`git clone https://github.com/yashiru1365/Nethunter-rootfs-full-minimum-nano-install-helper-`

cd Nethunter-rootfs-full-minimum-nano-install-helper-`

`chmod +x nethinstl.sh`
